# üìÅ GitHub Upload Instructions

## Quick Upload Guide for Your Website Files

Follow these simple steps to get your website files on GitHub and ready for Bluehost deployment.

## What You Need to Upload

From your project's `dist` folder, you need these files:
- `index.html` (main website file)
- `assets/` folder (contains CSS and JavaScript)
- Any other files in the `dist` directory

## Step-by-Step Upload Process

### 1. Create Your GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click the green "New" button** (or "New repository")
3. **Repository name:** `techtoolsreviews-website`
4. **Description:** `Professional affiliate marketing website for TechToolsReviews.com`
5. **Make it Public** ‚úÖ (easier for Bluehost integration)
6. **Don't check any boxes** (no README, .gitignore, or license)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### 2. Upload Your Files (Easy Method)

Since your repository is empty, GitHub will show you options. Choose the **"uploading an existing file"** link.

#### Upload Process:
1. **Click "uploading an existing file"**
2. **Open your project folder** and navigate to the `dist` folder
3. **Select ALL files** in the `dist` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets` folder
   - Any other files
4. **Drag and drop** them into the GitHub upload area
5. **Wait for upload** to complete (you'll see progress bars)

#### Commit Your Files:
1. **Scroll down** to the "Commit changes" section
2. **Commit message:** `Initial website deployment - production ready`
3. **Description:** `Uploading optimized website files for techtoolsreviews.com`
4. **Click "Commit changes"**

### 3. Verify Upload Success

After uploading, your repository should show:
- ‚úÖ `index.html` file
- ‚úÖ `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark indicating successful upload

## Alternative: Command Line Upload (Advanced Users)

If you're comfortable with command line:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files from dist folder
git add dist/*

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial website deployment"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Add GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## File Structure After Upload

Your GitHub repository should look like this:

```
techtoolsreviews-website/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                    # Main website file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].css         # Optimized CSS
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].js          # Optimized JavaScript
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [any other files from dist/]
```

## Important Notes

### ‚úÖ Do Upload:
- All files from the `dist` folder
- `index.html` (must be in root)
- `assets/` folder with CSS and JS
- Any image files if present

### ‚ùå Don't Upload:
- `node_modules/` folder
- `src/` folder (source code)
- `.env` files
- Development files

### File Size Limits:
- GitHub has a 100MB limit per file
- Your website files should be well under this limit
- If you have large images, consider optimizing them first

## Troubleshooting Upload Issues

### If Upload Fails:
1. **Check file sizes** - ensure no file is over 100MB
2. **Try smaller batches** - upload files in groups
3. **Check internet connection** - large uploads need stable connection
4. **Use GitHub Desktop** - alternative upload method

### If Files Don't Appear:
1. **Refresh the page** - sometimes takes a moment to show
2. **Check you're in the right repository**
3. **Verify you clicked "Commit changes"**

## Next Steps After Upload

Once your files are on GitHub:

1. ‚úÖ **Verify all files uploaded correctly**
2. ‚úÖ **Copy your repository URL** (you'll need this for Bluehost)
3. ‚úÖ **Proceed to Bluehost Git setup** (see DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Your Repository URL

After creating your repository, your URL will be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website
```

**Save this URL** - you'll need it for the Bluehost Git integration step.

## Security Note

Since this is a public repository:
- ‚úÖ No sensitive information is included
- ‚úÖ No API keys or passwords in the code
- ‚úÖ Only production-ready files are uploaded

## Ready for Bluehost!

Once your files are successfully uploaded to GitHub, you're ready to connect your repository to Bluehost and deploy your live website!

**Next:** Follow the Bluehost Git integration steps in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

**üéâ Great job!** Your website files are now safely stored on GitHub and ready for professional deployment to your live domain.
