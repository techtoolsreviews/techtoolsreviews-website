# 🔧 Bluehost Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Bluehost requires a `.cpanel.yml` file for Git deployments to work properly.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've created a `.cpanel.yml` file that tells Bluehost exactly how to deploy your website.

## What the .cpanel.yml File Does

```yaml
---
deployment:
  tasks:
    - export DEPLOYPATH=/home/$USER/public_html/
    - /bin/cp -R dist/* $DEPLOYPATH
    - /bin/cp -R *.md $DEPLOYPATH
    - /bin/cp README.md $DEPLOYPATH
```

This file:
1. **Sets the deployment path** to your website root (`public_html`)
2. **Copies all files** from the `dist` folder to your live site
3. **Includes documentation** files for reference

## 🚀 Updated Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Updated Files to GitHub

You need to upload these files to your GitHub repository:

**Required Files:**
- ✅ `.cpanel.yml` (the fix file I just created)
- ✅ All files from your `dist` folder
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- ✅ `AFFILIATE-SETUP.md`

### Step 2: GitHub Upload Process

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website`
2. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
3. **Upload these files:**
   - Drag the `.cpanel.yml` file
   - Drag all files from your `dist` folder
   - Drag all the `.md` documentation files
4. **Commit message**: `Add .cpanel.yml for Bluehost deployment`
5. **Click "Commit changes"**

### Step 3: Bluehost Git Setup (Updated)

1. **In Bluehost cPanel** → Git Version Control
2. **Click "Create"**
3. **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git`
4. **Repository Path**: `/public_html`
5. **Branch**: `main`
6. **Click "Create"**

### Step 4: Deploy Your Website

1. **In Git Version Control**, find your repository
2. **Click "Manage"**
3. **Click "Pull"** 
4. **Bluehost will now use the .cpanel.yml file** to deploy correctly

## 📁 Your Repository Structure Should Be:

```
techtoolsreviews-website/
├── .cpanel.yml                 # ← REQUIRED for Bluehost
├── dist/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── assets/
│       ├── index-DPHH2GMw.css
│       └── index-BXlPBDoQ.js
├── README.md
├── DEPLOYMENT.md
├── AFFILIATE-SETUP.md
└── bluehost-deployment-fix.md
```

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Bluehost's Git integration needs explicit instructions on:
- **Where to deploy files** (`public_html`)
- **Which files to copy** (contents of `dist` folder)
- **How to handle the deployment** (copy commands)

## ✅ After This Fix

Your deployment will:
1. **Copy your website files** to the correct location
2. **Maintain proper file structure**
3. **Deploy successfully** without errors

## 🚨 Important Notes

### File Permissions:
- The `.cpanel.yml` file must be in your repository root
- Bluehost will automatically execute the deployment tasks
- Your website files will be copied to `/public_html/`

### Testing:
After deployment, your website should be live at:
- `https://techtoolsreviews.com`
- `https://www.techtoolsreviews.com`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:
1. **Check the .cpanel.yml file** is in repository root
2. **Verify file permissions** in Bluehost File Manager
3. **Contact Bluehost support** - they're very helpful with Git issues

### If website doesn't load:
1. **Check File Manager** in cPanel - files should be in `public_html`
2. **Verify index.html** is in the root directory
3. **Clear browser cache** and try again

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Upload the .cpanel.yml file** to GitHub
2. **Try the Git deployment** again in Bluehost
3. **Your website should deploy successfully!**
4. **Replace affiliate links** with your real ones
5. **Start earning commissions!**
