# üîß Fix Bluehost Git Timeout Error

## The Error You're Seeing
```
Error: (XID sjzzn8) The system aborted the subprocess "/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/git" 
(process ID "1041430") because it reached the timeout of 5 seconds.
```

## What This Means
Bluehost's Git process is timing out while trying to connect to your GitHub repository. This usually happens due to:
- Network connectivity issues
- Repository size
- GitHub server response delays
- Incorrect repository URL format

## ‚úÖ Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Use HTTPS URL Format
Make sure you're using the correct GitHub URL format:

**‚úÖ Correct Format:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git
```

**‚ùå Avoid These Formats:**
```
git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git  (SSH)
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website  (Missing .git)
```

### Solution 2: Retry the Git Setup
Sometimes it's just a temporary network issue:

1. **Delete the existing Git repository** in Bluehost
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
3. **Try creating it again** with the exact same settings

### Solution 3: Check Repository Settings
Ensure your GitHub repository is properly configured:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll to "Danger Zone"**
4. **Verify repository is PUBLIC** (not private)
5. **If private, click "Change visibility" ‚Üí "Make public"**

### Solution 4: Use Smaller Repository
The timeout might be due to repository size:

1. **Create a new repository** with only essential files:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - `.cpanel.yml`
2. **Skip documentation files** for now (you can add them later)

### Solution 5: Alternative Git URL
Try using the raw GitHub URL without authentication:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git
```

### Solution 6: Manual File Upload (Backup Plan)
If Git continues to fail, upload files manually:

1. **Download your repository** as ZIP from GitHub
2. **Extract the files**
3. **In Bluehost File Manager**, go to `/public_html`
4. **Upload all files** from the `dist` folder
5. **Your website will be live immediately**

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Clean Up Previous Attempts
1. **In Bluehost cPanel** ‚Üí **Git Version Control**
2. **Find any existing repositories**
3. **Click "Delete"** on each one
4. **Wait 2 minutes** for cleanup

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Repository
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Check it's PUBLIC** (not private)
3. **Copy the exact URL**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git`
4. **Test the URL** in your browser (should show repository page)

### Step 3: Create Git Repository (Retry)
1. **In Bluehost** ‚Üí **Git Version Control**
2. **Click "Create"**
3. **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/techtoolsreviews-website.git`
4. **Repository Path**: `/public_html`
5. **Branch**: `main`
6. **Click "Create"** and wait patiently (up to 30 seconds)

### Step 4: If Still Timing Out
Try these alternative approaches:

**Option A: Contact Bluehost Support**
- They can increase the Git timeout limit

## üîç Common Causes & Solutions

### Network Issues:
- **Cause**: Bluehost server connectivity to GitHub
- **Solution**: Retry in 10-15 minutes

### Repository Size:
- **Cause**: Too many files causing timeout
- **Solution**: Create minimal repository with only essential files

### URL Format:
- **Cause**: Wrong GitHub URL format
- **Solution**: Use HTTPS format with `.git` extension
